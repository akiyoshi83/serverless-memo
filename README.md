# serverless-memo

Experimental project of serverless framework and Cognito User Pool.

## Note

Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool created via AWS CLI does not work well at the present time.
So now `bin/create-cognito-pool.sh` is not able to use to create cognito.
You should create pools by management console.
